# 3D-sketch-of-robot-leg using Cinema 4D
In this repository I have attached a Cinema 4D file for a 3D preliminary drawing of the 64 cm long robot leg with an explanation of the joint locations where each leg contains two joints to help the robot move. The drawing also shows the robot walking movement.
